Hi! I am a first-year Computer Science and Engineering PhD student at the University of Michigan, working in the [Graph Exploration and Mining at Scale (GEMS) Lab](https://gemslab.github.io/) under [Prof. Danai Koutra](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~dkoutra/). My research interests include graph machine learning, studying its limitations, and exploring multimodal integration approaches.

Previously, I obtained my master's degree from Boğaziçi University. There, I worked with Prof. İnci M. Baytaş on improving representation learning in graph neural networks (GNNs) by tackling over-smoothing and over-squashing phenomena.
