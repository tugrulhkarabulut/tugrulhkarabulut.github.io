Hi! I am a first-year Computer Science and Engineering PhD student at the University of Michigan. I am part of the [Graph Exploration and Mining at Scale (GEMS) Lab](https://gemslab.github.io/), supervised by [Prof. Danai Koutra](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~dkoutra/). My research interests include graph machine learning and its limitations as well as its integration with various modalities.

Previously, I have obtained my master's degree Boğaziçi University, where I worked on improving representation in graph neural networks (GNNs) by tackling over-smoothing and over-squashing phenomena under the supervision of Prof. İnci M. Baytaş.
